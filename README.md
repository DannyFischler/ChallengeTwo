# ChallengeTwo
This is the second challenge, my portfolio.
I intend to continue working on this as the course goes on, filling it with the work I do, and improving it with the different skills I learn.

Had a lot of trouble deploying to github pages. Deployes perfectely on google chrome and in codepen. Going to meet with a tutor asap to resubmit.
